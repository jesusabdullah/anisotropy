1)

On a personal level, I expect to gain knowledge through valuable feedback on my 
research, and by learning about the research of others. While I am confident
that my research is worthwhile, I also know that many people go to AGU with 
backgrounds very different from my own. Their perspective will be invaluable to 
me as I continue to study cryosphere phenomena. In addition, from these same
people I'll be able to learn about new ideas and disciplines other
than my own.

I suspect that this experience will not only benefit me on the level of personal
growth, but also with direct regards to extending my research.  Armed with new
knowledge from AGU, I will be able to modify and refine my approach as I
continue my studies, leading to more complete and relevant outcomes from my
research.

At this stage in my career, I may either continue research, or I may begin to work
in industry. Going to AGU will give me insight on this decision.
No matter what happens in my career, this practice in presenting my work will be invaluable in refining this skill, which is critical in any career.
