\chapter{Loose Ends and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Issues with assumptions in the analytical approach
\item Lack of good verification of numerical model
\item Unweildy model due to use of COMSOL 3.5---Could easily be rebuilt in
COMSOL 4.X
\item Quantify inaccuracies in benchtop experiments?
\item Make a better way to log angle for in-situ experiments
\item Make more in-situ measurements
\end{enumerate}
