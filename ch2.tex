\section{Introduction}

The technique used to measure thermal conductivity with a needle probe is based
on the assumption that the needle approximates an infinite line source of energy
with a constant heat flux embedded in an infinite medium. The origins of the
analytical solution for isotropic thermal conductivity may be found in Carslaw
and Jaeger's book, ``Conduction of Heat in Solids.'' \cite{basictheory}

The method based on Carslaw and Jaeger's solution depends on solving a 2-D
problem, where all planes orthogonal to the needle have the same temperature
distribution; in other words, temperature is not a function of axial position.
Moreover, the problem is further simplified by posing the problem into radial
coordinates and solving for temperature as a function of radial distance only.

In the isotropic case, this is straightforward, as conductivity is a constant
scalar. Unfortunately the anisotropic case is more complex, but luckily not
completely intractible.

\section{The Isotropic Case}

The isotropic case solves the following equation:

\begin{equation*}
k\nabla^2 T = \rho C\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
\end{equation*}

Where \(T\) is temperature, \(k\) is a scalar thermal conductivity, \(\rho\) is
density, \(C\) is volumetric heat capacity, and \(t\) is time.

By casting this problem into cylindrical coordinates, the equations may be
simplified such that they are a function of radial distance \(r\) only (as
temperature is assumed to not be a function of axial position \(z\) or angle
\(\phi\)).

After applying this transformation and solving the equation, the analytical
solution to the problem becomes:

\begin{equation}
\label{isotropic_ei}
T(r,t) = - \frac{q}{4\pi k}\Ei\left(-\frac{r^2}{4kt}\right)
\end{equation}

where \(q\) is heat flux from the needle per linear distance, and \(\Ei()\) is
as defined in Equation \ref{eq:ei} for real-valued arguments.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ei}
\Ei(x) = -\int_{-x}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t}}{t}dt
\end{equation}

Solving for the exponential integral analytically is not possible, and numerical
solutions can be difficult. Typically, an approximation for small
\(r^2/t\) is used instead:

\begin{equation}
\label{isotropic_case}
T(r,t) = \frac{q}{4\pi k}\ln\left(\frac{4kt}{r^2}\right) - \frac{\gamma q}{4\pi k}
\end{equation}

Typical use of this function is to find \(\frac{dT}{d(\ln t)}\) and solve
for \(k\). Equation \ref{isotropic_case} will be used for the remainder of
this analysis, though it could easily be applied to Equation \ref{isotropic_ei} as well.


\section{Difficulties In The Anisotropic Case}
\label{sec:analytical-np:anisotropic-diff}


The anisotropic case varies from the isotropic one in that instead of a scalar 
thermal conductivity \(k\), one must solve the problem using an \(n \times n\)
thermal conductivity, \([K]\), where \(n\) is the number of dimensions in the
problem. As a consequence, reducing the problem into two dimensions becomes more
difficult. Moreover, when the problem is posed in cylindrical coordinates, the
solution becomes a function not only of \(r\), but of \(\phi\) as well.

\section{Posing The Problem in Two Coordinates}
\label{sec:analytical-np:2D}

By assuming that temperature distribution is not a function of axial direction
\(z\), one may reduce the problem to an analogous one in orthogonal directions
\(x\) and \(y\) instead:

\begin{equation}
\nabla_{xy} \cdot \left([K]_{2 \times 2}\nabla_{xy} T \right)= \rho C\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

Without loss of generality, it may be further simplified like so:

\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \left(\begin{bmatrix}k_x & 0\\ 0 & k_y\end{bmatrix}\nabla T \right)= \rho C\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

This may be done by choosing the directions \(x\) and \(y\) such that the
matrix is diagonal.

The values of \(k_x\) and \(k_y\) may be found by finding the components of
\([K]\) that are in the \(xy\) plane.

%, as illustrated in \ref{fig:projection}. 
In particular, Equation \ref{eq:projection} was used in practice.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:projection}
\left[ k_x, k_y \right] = 
\Eig\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}
\left[K\right]\right)
\end{equation}

\section{Coordinate Transformation}
\label{sec:analytical-np:transformation}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/coordinate_transformation.png}
\caption{A 2-dimensional linear coordinate transformation.}
\label{fig:coord_trans}
\end{figure}

In order to apply the isotropic solution to this anisotropic case, a coordinate transformation may be applied such that the problem is transformed into
an isotropic case with respect to some \(x' = a_x x\) and \(y' = a_y y\), as in
Figure \ref{fig:coord_trans}.
Without loss of generality, suppose \(a_x = 1\).

\begin{align}
\frac{dx'}{dx} &= 1\\
\frac{dy'}{dy} &= a_y\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x'}\frac{dx'}{dx} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x'}\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial y'}\frac{dy'}{dy} = a_y\frac{\partial f}{\partial y'}\\
\nabla T &= \frac{\partial T}{\partial x'} \e_{x'} + a_y\frac{\partial T}{\partial y'} \e_{y'} \\
[K]\nabla T &= k_x\frac{\partial T}{\partial x'} \e_{x'} + k_ya_y\frac{\partial T}{\partial y'} \e_{y'}\\
\nabla \cdot \left([K]\nabla T\right) &= k_x\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial {x'}^2} + k_ya_y^2\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial {y'}^2}\\
\end{align}

Suppose the right hand side is equal to the equivalent isotropic expression:
\begin{equation*}
k\left(\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial {x'}^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial {y'}^2} \right) = k_x\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial {x'}^2} + k_ya_y^2\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial {y'}^2}
\end{equation*}

As a result,

\begin{align*}
k &= k_x\\ a_y &= \sqrt{\frac{k_x}{k_y}}\\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the following coordinate transformation will allow for the application
of isotropic solutions to an isotropic case with \(k = k_x\):

\begin{equation}
    \label{coord_trans}
    \begin{pmatrix}x' \\ y'\end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & \sqrt{\frac{k_x}{k_y}} \end{bmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x \\ y\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\section{From Temperature Distribution to Effective Thermal Conductivity}

Using Equation \ref{coord_trans}, the isotropic solution may be applied:

\begin{equation}
    k_x \nabla^2 T = \rho C\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

and get the following result (for sufficiently large \(t/(r')^2\)):

\begin{equation}
T(r',t) = \frac{q}{4\pi k_x}\ln\left(\frac{4k_xt}{r'^2}\right) - \frac{\gamma q}{4\pi k_x}
\end{equation}

In the isotropic case, the value of \(r\) does not change the derivative with
respect to the natural log of time, as long as it is assumed constant. In contrast, the anisotropic case requires that another transformation is applied
to \(r'\) so that both \(k_x\) and \(k_y\) may be recovered. This requires that
some contextual meaning is assigned to \(r\) and \(r'\). In this analysis, it
is assumed that the measurement occurs at some  \(r = r_{\textrm{0}}\), perhaps
on the surface of the physical needle.

This approach isn't without its problems. For example, it supposes that the
isotherms are all circles in the transformed geometry, but if a finite-sized
needle was actually being modeled in the problem then the isotherms near the
(elliptically-shaped in the transformed domain) needle would be elliptical as
well, and only isotherms sufficiently far away would be round. However, this
approach allows us to keep using the \(\ln()\) approximation, while a solution
given a finite needle would likely require the use of Bessel functions.

Applying this technique to the anisotropic case, \(r_{xy} = \cos(\theta) \hat{e}_x + \sin(\theta) \hat{e}_y \) must also be transformed
into \(r_{x'y'}\):

\begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix}r_{x'} \\ r_{y'}\end{pmatrix} &=
    \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & \sqrt{\frac{k_x}{k_y}} \end{bmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}r_0\cos(\theta) \\ r_0\sin(\theta)\end{pmatrix}\\
    &= r_0\left(\cos(\theta) \e_x + \sqrt{\frac{k_x}{k_y}} \e_y \right)\\
\end{align*}
\begin{equation}
    \norm{r'}^2 = r_0^2 \left(\cos^2(\theta) + \frac{k_x}{k_y}\sin^2(\theta) \right)\\
\end{equation}

This means that the temperature around the needle should now vary as a function
of \(\theta\), unlike in the isotropic case. Now, since the needle only measures
a single value, it may be assumed that the measured quantity is an
average temperature, such as the average surface temperature of the probe.  This
may be expressed like so:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tavg}
T_{\textrm{avg}}(t) = \frac{4\pi k_x}{q} \frac{\mathcal{E}(\ln(t), \frac{k_x}{k_y})}{\mathcal{E}(1, \frac{k_x}{k_y})}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}(f(\phi, \alpha), \alpha) = \int_0^{2\pi} f\sqrt{\cos^2(\phi) + \alpha\sin^2(\phi)} d\phi
\end{equation}

\section{Finding Effective Conductivity as a Function of Needle Orientation}

In order to extract the effective \(k\) value, a function of the form
\(C_1 \ln(t) + C_2\) is fit to Equation \ref{eq:tavg}. Then, all that is left is to evaluate the functions at various combinations of
\(k_xy\), \(k_z\) and \(\theta\).

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:analytical-np:conclusion}

An analytical approach to studying anisotropic thermal conductivity with needle
probes is more difficult than with the isotropic case. However, by using
coordinate projections to pose the problem in two dimensions, and by applying
coordinate transformations to the domain, one may apply the accepted isotropic
theory to the anisotropic case with minimal modification.  By numerically
evaluating the predicted temperature distribution over time, one may find the
expected conductivity measurement given the theory holds for anisotropic
materials.
