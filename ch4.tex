\section{Needle Probe Measurement Fundamentals}

Needle probe measurements were taken using an apparatus borrowed from the Cold
Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, illustrated in figure
\ref{fig:apparatus}. Encased in a Pelican case for protection are a Campbell
CR10X data logger, a relay switch, a 12v gel cell for the CR10X and a series of
D-cells to power the heating coils in the needle. The program that came with the
data logger uses the relay switch to control the heat flux from the needle, and
records temperature data from the needle's thermocouple, as well as the voltage
across the heating element, over the course of a five minute heating curve and
a ten minute cooling curve.

The apparatus is controlled using a keypad that enables one to communicate
with the data logger using Campbell ``star-codes.'' Initiating a test is a
matter of clearing and setting some registers using these star-codes.

\marginpar{source star codes?}

In general, the apparatus is used like so:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Turn on device.
\item Insert needle into medium being measured.
\item Use star-codes to clear the first three registers. ``* 6 A'' accesses the
registers, and ``D \(n\)'' toggles the \(n\)th register. For example, to clear
the second register, press ``* 6 A D 2'' .
\item Turn on the first register by pressing ``* 6 A D 1''. This makes the
apparatus measure temperature.
\item Turn on the second register by pressing ``* 6 A D 2''. This turns on the
heating element, effectively starting the test.
\item Wait 15 minutes for test to complete.
\end{enumerate}

Once testing is complete, data may be uploaded from the data logger using
Campbell's PC200X software and a particular series of cables and devices, as
shown in figure \ref{fig:cable}. In order, from datalogger to computer, they
are:

\marginpar{Source PC200X?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A DE-9 cable
\item an SC32A optically isolating RS-232 interface
\item A DB-25-to-DE-9 serial cable
\item A DE-9 Null Modem cable
\item (Optional) A DE-9-to-USB cable
\end{enumerate}

Given the correct cables and ports, one may be able to decrease the number of
cables to two, plus the SC32A interface.

\end{figure}

Using PC200W, data may be pulled off the CR10X in a raw binary format and then
converted to a CSV format. For this particular experiment, the columns from left
to right represented:

    data.headers = ( 'logger_id'
                   , 'day'
                   , 'hourmin'
                   , 'sec'
                   , 'needletemp'
                   , 'reftemp'
                   , 'volts'
                   , 'timer')


\begin{enumerate}
\item An instrument ID (not used).
\item Ordinal day, out of 366. For example, March 17th is day 76.
\item hh:mm portion of timestamp. For example, 6:30pm is represented as 1830.
\item Seconds portion of timestamp.
\item Needle temperature, in Celcius.
\item Reference temperature, in Celcius.
\item Voltage across needle probe, in millivolts.
\item Experiment timer, in seconds.
\end{enumerate}

This csv data may be analyzed with either spreadsheet software, a series of
scripts, or both. For this series of experiments, Excel and Gnumeric were used
to verify the existence of data and to combine datasets, while python was used
for the analysis.

\marginpar{Organization?}
Generally, each measurement also has some metadata associated with it. In
particular, anisotropic measurements have an angle associated with them, and
snow measurements also have a coordinate position on the snowpack associated
with them. This means that, while taking measurements, one has to be careful to
make sure that they can keep the proper metadata associated with each
measurement. An unfortunate situation that can occur after a long series of
measurements may recall memories of finishing an SAT section and realizing that
you missed a question part-way through. \marginpar{appropriate?}

Unlike the case of numerical experiments, it is extremely important in
real-world experiments---especially in the case of snow---to hand-inspect every
time/temperature curve. This is because, unlike the numerical experiments, there
is a significant chance that data will be garbage. In the case of snow in
particular, convection is typically experienced near the end of the heating
curve and the beginning of the cooling curve.

\section{Snow Conductivity Measurements}

The first step in measuring proper snow is to make a vertical cut in the
snowpack, as in figure \ref{fig:snowpack}.

Snow is relatively difficult to work with due to the low structural integrity
of the material.  The wire connecting the probe to the data logger is stiff
enough a low temperatures that situating the needle without ruining the snowpack
can be quite a challenge.
