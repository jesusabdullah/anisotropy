This is my thesis! Yes that's right, all of it. Not just the written document,
but also all of the code.

The part everyone would actually want to see is, predictably,
**[/thesis.pdf](https://github.com/jesusabdullah/anisotropy/blob/master/thesis.pdf?raw=true)**.
It's pretty awesome. No, really. Read it! Gogogo.

Want a tl;dr? Then check out
**[/papers/poster/poster.pdf](https://github.com/jesusabdullah/anisotropy/blob/master/papers/poster/poster.pdf?raw=true)**, a revised version of the poster I made for
AGU Fall 2010!

However, for the graduate student at UAF interested in
extending what I've done, you may find some files of interest here. In
particular, **/fea_analysis** contains the COMSOL code (though I would
recommend rewriting the simulation using COMSOL 4.0), **/analytical_solution**
contains code for numerically evaluating solutions based on an analytical
approach (so yes, "analytical solution" is a misnomer), and **/measurements**
contains all the code I wrote for doing laboratory and in-situ measurements,
plus data. **/papers** has some small papers and other such documents I've
written (including a sweet poster), and **/thesis** is the source code for the
thesis itself. Note that, in order to compile the thesis you will need version
5.0 of <https://github.com/jesusabdullah/uafthesis>. Finally,
**/convergence_study** contains some material from when I informally analyzed
the convergence properties of the model (In retrospect, I should've tried to
coarsen the mesh as well as refining it), and **/extras** has a few odds and
ends that didn't really make sense anywhere else.

Enjoy!
