I would like to thank my parents for preparing me for academia in my youth and
for supporting me once I was out of their house; my friends at 503 Long Spur
Loop for all the card games we played; Pete and James for enabling productive
procrastination; Rorik Peterson, for being not only the best advisor of all time
but also a friend; Jerry Johnson, Matthew Sturm and Ed Bueler and everybody else
that offered their guidance and support; and my brother for all the times he
lent me the use of his truck.
