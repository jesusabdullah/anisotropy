I would like to thank my parents for preparing me for academia in my youth and
for supporting me once I was out of their house; my friends at 503 Long Spur
Loop for all the card games we played; Dustin, Kyle and Bender and all my other
fellow engineering grad students for talkin' nerdy to me; Pete and James for
enabling productive procrastination; Rorik Peterson, for being not only the best
advisor of all time but also a friend; Jerry Johnson, Matthew Sturm, Ed Bueler
and everybody else that offered their guidance and support; and my brother
for all the times he lent me the use of his truck.
