I would like to thank: My parents for preparing me for academia in my youth and
for supporting me once I was out of their house; My friends at 503 Long Spur
Loop for all the card games we played; Pete & James for enabling productive
procrastination; and my brother for all the times he lent
me the use of his truck.
