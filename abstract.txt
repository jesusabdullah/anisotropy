A new method for measuring anisotropic thermal conductivity is being adapted from the current standard method of measuring isotropic thermal conductivity with needle probes. This method depends on approximate numerical solutions to the apparent thermal conductivity of the measured material as a function of actual anisotropic thermal conductivity and the orientation of the needle, and requires multiple measurements to solve for the anisotropic thermal conductivity. This method will be used to measure the thermal conductivity of snowpack to better understand the behavior of the material and to improve arctic climate models.
