\section{Parameters and Nondimensionalization}

For most analyses, many of the parameters and results are non-dimensionalized. In
particular, instead of separate parameters for \(k_z\) and \(k_{xy}\), \(k_z\)
and \(k_{\textrm{eff}}\) are both normalized by \(k_{xy}\). Numerical
experiments verified that this is permissible, as numerical experiments with
different \(k_z\) and \(k_{xy}\) parameters but equivalent ratios
\(\fracflat{k_z}{k_{xy}}\) resulted in very similar ratios of
\(\fracflat{k_{\textrm{eff}}}{k_{xy}}\).

Angle is an exception. In this analysis, all angles are given as degrees from
the horizontal (\(xy\)) plane.

\section{Numerical vs. Analytical Predictions}

A 3-D plot of the numerical and analytical predictions may be seen in 
Figures \ref{fig:numvanal}. This plot shows that the two approaches to predicting measured conductivity
as a function of angle and anisotropy ratio have similar trends. However,
there are important disagreements which must be resolved.

general agreement. Grey dots represent numerical simulation results, the grey surface represents an interpolating surface of the dots, and the blue surface represents the analytical model. Disagreement between the two may be due to edge effects and/or numerical
model convergence issues.}
\label{fig:numvanal}
\end{figure}

Many details may be seen more readily in two-dimensional plots. In particular,
Figure \ref{fig:by_angle} shows theoretical predictions from both the analytical
and numerical model as a function of anisotropic conductivity ratios, sliced by
angle, while Figure \ref{fig:by_kratio} shows theoretical predictions from both
methods as a function of angle, sliced by anisotropic conductivity ratios.
Figure \ref{fig:by_angle} readily shows that an increase in conductivity ratio
above \(1\) has a weaker effect on effective conductivity for the numerical
model than in the analytical model. This may be due to edge effects decreasing
the effective thermal conductivity in the numerical model by conducting heat
axially from the needle. The analytical model, in contrast, does not model edge
effects, as it models an infinitely long needle like the
original needle probe method. For the isotropic case, these edge effects have
been studied and quantified analytically by other researchers. \cite{axialerror}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/byAngle.png}
\caption{Slices of theoretical predictions by angle. Black points connected by dashed lines represent numerical results, while solid blue lines represent analytical theory. It can be seen that the analytical theory predicts measured conductivity to be a stronger function of angle than the numerical data at
higher conductivity ratios.}
\label{fig:by_angle}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:by_kratio} also shows the smoothing seen in Figure 
\ref{fig:by_angle}, but also readily shows the predictions of both models for
the isotropic case (\(\flatfrac{k_{\textrm{eff}}}{k_{xy}} = 1\)). Both models
correctly predict that effective thermal conductivity is not a function of angle
for the isotropic case. However, it is also clear that the numerical model
over-predicts \(k_{\textrm{eff}}\) by at least \(10\%\). 

The dominant cause for this discrepancy is believed to be due to using a model with too
coarse of a mesh. The convergence study results show that, while the time/temperature curves look
largely the same (Figure \ref{fig:conv_curves}), that the minor differences are magnified when taking the
derivative with respect to \(\ln(t)\) such that the coarse grid reports a
thermal conductivity of about \(110\%\) of the finer grid (Table \ref{tab:conv_kvals}).
This difference is of the same order of magnitude as the difference seen between
the numerical predictions and the analytical predictions, and it is believed that
running the same simulations at a finer grid would resolve most of the difference
seen, particularly in the isotropic case.

However, some of this may also be due to edge effects, as evidenced by the cluster
of points at the zero angle
(More readily seen in Figure \ref{fig:angle0}), where it can be seen that, in fact,
the predictions for the numerical method are a very weak function of \(k_{xy}\)
and not just the ratio of the anisotropic conductivities. Simply repeating the
experiments at higher resolutions of mesh should be able to resolve this problem.

\caption{Slices of theoretical predictions by \(\flatfrac{k_z}{k_{xy}}\). Black points connected by dashed lines represent numerical results, while solid blue lines represent analytical theory. It can be seen that the analytical theory
is perfect for the isotropic case (\(\flatfrac{k_z}{k_{xy}} = 1\)), while the numerical experiments report larger-than-expected values.}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/conv_curves.png}
\caption{A comparison of two \(T(t)\) curves from equivalent simulations with 
different fineness of mesh. These two curves appear quite similar, but their long-
time slopes are measurably different}
\label{fig:conv_curves}
\end{figure}


\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{A comparison of \(k_{\textrm{eff}}\) from two equivalent simulations 
with different fineness of mesh. Despite the similarities in time/temperature
curves, the resulting  conductivity calculations differ by nearly 10 \%. Units are in W\(/\)m\(\cdot\)K.}
\input{tables/conv_kvals.tex}
\label{tab:conv_kvals}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:angle0} shows predictions for the special case of
\(\theta = 0 \), where the needle is oriented parallel to the planes of isotropy.
This special case is of interest because previous needle probe measurements have
determined effective conductivities at this angle, which may or may not be
accurate representations of \(k_z\), the vertical thermal conductivity, which is
what is measured by a guarded hot plate apparatus and is the conductivity
of interest to climatologists modeling heat transfer between the atmosphere and
soil. If predictions for \(k_{\textrm{eff}}\) are \emph{equal} to \(k_z\), then
the measured \(k_{\textrm{eff}}\) accurately reflects \(k_z\). This agreement
between measurements seems unlikely for anisotropic measurements, and in fact 
the numerical model shows the expected trend of \(k_{\textrm{eff}} > k_z\) for
low conductivity ratios, and \(k_{\textrm{eff}} < k_z\) for higher conductivity
ratios. However, the analytical model predicts that \(k_{\textrm{eff}} = k_z\)
for all anisotropy ratios. While the analytical model shows expected behavior
for the isotropic case and shows the general trends one would expect, this
surprising result casts doubt onto the validity of the analytical model.

The analytical predictions are indistinguishable from this line, and are therefore not plotted.}

\section{Benchtop Measurements}

\caption{A comparison of the benchtop measurements with the numerical and
analytical predictions for alternating layers of salt and sugar, given the

\label{fig:test_results}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Raw data from the benchtop measurements. Note that one of the cooling curve measurements is striked out. This is because, when examined, it is clearly an outlier. Units are in W\(/\)m\(\cdot\)K.}
\input{tables/powders.tex}
\label{tab:powders}
\end{table}


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/test_results_confidence.png}
\caption{Upper and lower bounds of 95 \% confidence in thermal conductivity measurements of the salt and sugar layered samples. This analysis 
indicates that the measurements can not statistically exclude a null hypothesis.}
\label{fig:test_confidence}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Basic statistics on normalized benchtop measurements.  Units are in W\(/\)m\(\cdot\)K.}
\input{tables/pow_stats.tex}
\label{tab:pow_stats}
\end{table}


It may be seen that there is a significant amount of variation between
benchtop measurements using the needle probe method in Figure \ref{fig:test_results} and Table \ref{tab:pow_stats}, even accounting for obviously failed measurements such as the removed outlier in Table \ref{tab:powders}.
This is likely due in part to the nature of numerical derivatives as well as the relatively
unpredictable behavior of porous materials. Given
this variation, it is difficult to see which of the two models (analytical or numerical) is more appropriate.

Based on a general curve fit, the benchtop results show a slight upward slope (Figure \ref{fig:test_results}) as
expected. However, given the variation in the benchtop results, it is statistically
possible that angle has absolutely no effect on the reading. This could be fixed
with more careful, exacting standards in the construction of the anisotropic
materials, more measurements at each angle, and measurements at more angles.
In other words, given the variance of the measurements, many more measurements
would have to be made in order to reach any statistically significant
conclusions, at least given the relatively low amount of anisotropy of the sample.

Also given this variation and the relatively weak levels of anisotropy in the
sample, even with more measurements it could still prove difficult to deduce
the degree of anisotropy of the sample with this data and a curve fit to either
the numerical or analytical predictions alone.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/snow_meas.png}
\caption{Conductivity measurements in roughly the same layer of snow at various 
angles. Even a limited amount of in-situ snow measurements suggest a degree of

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/snow_meas_boxplot.png}
\caption{These boxplots give a general idea of the differences in measurements
between the near-horizontal angle and the more oblique ones in snow.}
\label{fig:test_boxplot}
\end{figure}


Due to the difficulty in taking snow measurements, very few snow measurements were
successfully completed (Table \ref{tab:snow}). This, on top of the inherent variation between measurements seen in the method, snow measurements are also inconclusive. However, the
measurements taken \emph{do} indicate anisotropy to a greater degree of confidence
than the benchtop measurements, as may be seen in Figures \ref{fig:snow_results}
 and \ref{fig:test_boxplot}. Like the case of the benchtop measurements, with so few
measurements a curve fit against either method of prediction is unlikely to
yield useful results.

While the degree of anisotropy of the snow sample is unknown, it is known that
the measurements indicate a \(\flatfrac{k_z}{k_xy}\) of less than one, which is
indicative of the aggregate anisotropy seen from a geometry of alternating
layers, and not of the particular structural anisotropy that is seen in some
types of snow such as depth hoar \emph{or} or the sort of anisotropy that could
explain the discrepancies between needle probe and guarded hot plate measurements.
This is not surprising, as the measurements were taken in a layered region in
order to increase the chances of detecting anisotropy.

To put the snow measurements in context for comparison in future studies, Table
\ref{tab:density} shows the snow density in the region of snow
that these measurements were taken.

\section{Ramifications}

These results indicate that anisotropy is possible to measure in snow. However,
due to variance between measurements, this may be more difficult than hoped for.
While only two perfect measurements would likely be required to ascertain the
anisotropic thermal conductivity of snow given a proven model, the variance seen
in these measurements suggests that many more measurements would be
required---somewhere on the order of five to ten measurements per angle would
likely be required for statistically significant results.

However, horizontal measurements do reflect vertical conductivity to a degree,
and for small levels of anisotropy (likely if the anisotropy is on the aggregate
level only) horizontal measurements may be sufficient for ascertaining vertical
conductivity.

Given that anisotropy was detected in the snowpack, it is possible that snow
anisotropy is responsible for the discrepancies between guarded hot plate
measurements and needle probe measurements. However, because aggregate anisotropy
would lead us to predict higher in-plane conductivity than out-of-plane conductivity,
only structural anisotropy can explain this discrepancy.
