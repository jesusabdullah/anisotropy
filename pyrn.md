## AGU abstract including title and authors:

> Determination of Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity with Thermal Needle Probe Measurements  
> Joshua Holbrook, Rorik Peterson, Jerome Johnson

> A new method for measuring thermal conductivity is being adapted from
> the standard method of measuring isotropic thermal conductivity with
> needle probes, ASTM D5334, in order to enable the dertermination of an
> anisotropic thermal conductivity. This method will have particular
> relevance to measuring thermal conductivity of natural snowpacks where
> conductivity  can be strongly anisotropic due to vertical thermal
> gradients, compaction and metamorphosis. Needle probes, such as
> specified in ASTM D5334, consist of a thin needle embedded with a
> constant-flux heating element and a thermocouple or thermistor.
> Thermal conductivity of the surrounding material is calculated
> analytically using needle temperature data as a function of time.
> 
> This new method uses finite element numerical solutions for apparent
> thermal conductivity as a function of actual anisotropic thermal
> conductivity and needle orientation. Values for anisotropic thermal
> conductivity are determined by curve-fitting a function relating
> apparent results of the ASTM method at given needle orientations and
> the actual solutions. The results of the numerical simulations may
> then be applied to the measurement of actual anisotropic materials.
> Unlike ASTM D5334, multiple measurements at different orientations are
> required, and relies the number of free variables in the heat equation
> (with an upper bound of six for a symmetric conductivity matrix, which
> may be reduced with further simplifications).
> 
> The applicability and feasibility of this technique for improving
> arctic climate models, which can strongly depend on snow conductivity,
> will be discussed.

## Brief statement of why your study is important to permafrost science (<150 words):

While my current study focuses on applications to snowpack, it is being developed with the intent of measuring anisotropic thermal conductivities for arbitrary materials, including permafrost. Permafrost, particular in the case of ice lensing in the transition layer, is highly anisotropic due to the layered nature of these lenses. In fact, the ramifications of this anisotropy in the formation of ice lensing are not completely understood and measurements of anisotropic thermal conductivity in permafrost could help to determine this. The anisotropic thermal conductivity of permafrost is also of interest to those who build infrastructure in and near permafrost, such as pilings and thermosiphons, and those who develop Arctic climate models. Moreover, the interplay between climate and permafrost is dependent on heat flux between the atmosphere and ground cover, including natural snowpack.

## Brief statement of your motivation to attend the AGU Fall Meeting (<150 words):

Aside from being able to share and present my research, I hope to gain feedback from fellow conference attendees. While I am confident that my studies are worthwhile, I also know that many people go to AGU with backgrounds very different from my own (that is, mechanical engineering). In light of this, I suspect that I stand to learn a lot from them, and their perspectives and reactions to my work will be extremely useful to me as I continue to study anisotropic thermal conductivity.  In addition to feedback on my particular project, I plan to examine others' research, comment on it in-kind, and learn about all sorts of exciting new ideas and unfamiliar disciplines.
