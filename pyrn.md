> Determination of Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity with Thermal Needle Probe Measurements  
> Joshua Holbrook, Rorik Peterson, Jerome Johnson

> A new method for measuring thermal conductivity is being adapted from
> the standard method of measuring isotropic thermal conductivity with
> needle probes, ASTM D5334, in order to enable the dertermination of an
> anisotropic thermal conductivity. This method will have particular
> relevance to measuring thermal conductivity of natural snowpacks where
> conductivity  can be strongly anisotropic due to vertical thermal
> gradients, compaction and metamorphosis. Needle probes, such as
> specified in ASTM D5334, consist of a thin needle embedded with a
> constant-flux heating element and a thermocouple or thermistor.
> Thermal conductivity of the surrounding material is calculated
> analytically using needle temperature data as a function of time.
> 
> This new method uses finite element numerical solutions for apparent
> thermal conductivity as a function of actual anisotropic thermal
> conductivity and needle orientation. Values for anisotropic thermal
> conductivity are determined by curve-fitting a function relating
> apparent results of the ASTM method at given needle orientations and
> the actual solutions. The results of the numerical simulations may
> then be applied to the measurement of actual anisotropic materials.
> Unlike ASTM D5334, multiple measurements at different orientations are
> required, and relies the number of free variables in the heat equation

> may be reduced with further simplifications).

> The applicability and feasibility of this technique for improving
> arctic climate models, which can strongly depend on snow conductivity,
> will be discussed.

## Brief statement of why your study is important to permafrost science (<150 words):

While my AGU paper focuses on applications to snowpack, the technique is being developed for the purpose of measuring anisotropic thermal conductivity for all components of the natural Arctic landscape including permafrost. Permafrost is highly anisotropic, particularly in the transition region near the base of the active layer, due to the horizontally-layered ice lenses in this region. In fact, the ramifications of permafrost anisotropy due to ice lensing are not completely understood, and measurements of anisotropic thermal conductivity in permafrost could help elucidate these effects. The anisotropic thermal conductivity of permafrost is also of interest to those who build engineering infrastructure in permafrost regions, including bridge pilings and thermosiphon installations. Furthermore, Arctic climate models can be highly dependent on permafrost properties where the the energy balance is dependent on heat flux between the atmosphere and ground cover, including natural snowpack.

## Brief statement of your motivation to attend the AGU Fall Meeting (<150 words):

Aside from being able to share and present my research, I hope to gain feedback from fellow conference attendees. While I am confident that my studies are worthwhile, I also know that many people go to AGU with backgrounds very different from my own (that is, mechanical engineering). In light of this, I suspect that I stand to learn a lot from them, and their perspectives and reactions to my work will be extremely useful to me as I continue to study anisotropic thermal conductivity.  In addition to feedback on my particular project, I plan to examine others' research, comment on it in-kind, and learn about all sorts of exciting new ideas and unfamiliar disciplines.
